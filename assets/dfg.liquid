                        <p class="mission-content">We believe skincare should be simple, clean and effective.
                            Over the years, formulations have become quite advanced, and in many ways that’s a positive
                            thing.
                            But some fundamental methodologies have been lost in the process. We use ingredients that
                            have been scientifically proven to work and left behind the toxic ones that can harm our
                            skin, body and mind.
                            Our mission is to create 100% pure, organic, vegan-based formulas that help us maintain
                            beautiful skin and feel consciously good too.</p>
                        <p class="mission-content"> What started with one product,
                            our Award-Winning Anti-Stretch Mark Cream #1 on Amazon’s new skincare product launches, has
                            now grown into a more diverse line of skincare products.
                            And we’re still growing and continuing to formulate new products thanks to you and your
                            feedback.
                            And nope, we’re not mad scientists; we’re just two moms, one a board-certified dermatologist
                            and the other a beauty industry veteran,
                            who did a lot of research because we believe in women feeling beautiful inside and out. We
                            love it, and we hope you do too!</p>
                        <p class="mission-content">Love! </p>
